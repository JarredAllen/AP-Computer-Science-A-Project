Welcome to Tank Trouble
This batch script will provide instructions on how to play Tank Trouble
I recommed reading this if you do not know how to play

In this game, players play as tanks and try to kill each other
Even one glancing hit by a bullet is fatal, so try to avoid being hit

At the test drive world, you can play around with the tanks and see how the controls work.
To get to it, click on the button from the main menu to start,
then click the button labeled ^"Test Controls^".

At the test drive screen, each player's controls are displayed
The tank with a mouse picture below it is controlled by the mouse
The other tanks have the keyboard controls displayed below them, formatted as such
     forward      
left  shoot  right
       back       

At the options screen, press the plus and minus arrows to increase or decrease the number of players,
the amount of time, or the difficulty level of the AIs.
A level 2 AI is very hard to beat, and having more than one level 2 AI WILL cause HEAVY lag.

Congradulations! You have reached the end of the help file.
You are now ready to play!
