PROJECT TITLE: Tank Trouble
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Game
VERSION or DATE: 6/1/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Create a new MenuScreen object. This should be handled automatically by Greenfoot.
AUTHORS: Jarred Allen, Matthew Cho, Sean Kim, and Samuel Guerrero
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
    Open the file "project.greenfoot" to get Greenfoot to load it. If it does not load the correct world to start you at, make a new MenuScreen object.
    From there, the game should explain the controls enough
    (just don't start playing in a battle until you know the rules).
