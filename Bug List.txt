Undocumented Feature List:

The game lags with multiple level 2 AIs or 4 level 1 AIs.
The game sometimes lags if a player is killed (should go away with time)
Bullets sometimes bounce weirdly if shot at the outside of a corner.
Tanks can sometimes get stuck facing along a wall if no clear pixels are between it and the wall
Tanks can sometimes get stuck on a wall end with no walls next to it for some physics glitch.
Red sometimes can't shoot (should be fixed, but there is a small chance it might not be).

Greenfoot sometimes freezes. Try reseting the program. If that doesn't work, close and reopen Greenfoot. If that doesn't work run killGreenfoot.bat in the project directory and then open Greenfoot.
